Here are the instructions for our game, PetCity. We have worked mostly from command line (Oakley is more comfortable there), so our project might look a bit different than others.

PetCity is broken into Python files that reference each other. It helps us keep our classes in check.

All you will need to do is download the PetCity.zip file, unpack it, then up PetCity.py in the src folder. This should successfully lauch our game.

The controls are as follow: either click your attack option, or press 1/2/3 (corresponds to the order on the bottom of the screen).

Punch beats special, special beats counter, and counter beats punch. The results are tracked in the terminal, as well as with the health bars above the characters.

This alpha is showing off the game logic. Sprites, music, more feedback, and (hopefully some) animation is to come!
